Evaluate need validity of the idea from the toC and toB perspectives.

## toC score

0: Cannot determine the consumer need / Cannot imagine any consumer-facing product
1 (Low): The need exists, but the qualitative/quantitative cost is low, so most people do not seek a solution
    Example: Earphone cables getting tangled
2: (Medium): The need exists and has a certain qualitative/quantitative cost, but it is not critical, so some people may not seek a solution
    Example: Shoulder stiffness from PC work
3 (High): The need exists and the qualitative/quantitative cost is high; a solution is clearly demanded
    Example: Risk of falls for elderly people living at home

## toB score

0 (not_to_b): This is not a toB (business-oriented) product
1 (Low): Both qualitative and quantitative returns are small
2 (Medium): Either the quantitative return (e.g., measurable monetary benefit) or the qualitative return (e.g., value essential for company growth) is large
    Examples:
        Quantitative return: Cost reduction
        Qualitative return: Knowledge transfer
3 (High): Both quantitative and qualitative returns are large
