Your task is to score **Specificity** of the idea.

## Scores

1: Not readable as language (not a coherent sentence or phrase)
2: Readable as language, but the intention or meaning of the idea is mostly unclear; difficult to imagine any specific product or service
    Example: “A platform that contributes to carbon neutrality” → the specific product or service is unclear
3: One or more specific products can be imagined (some ambiguity remains, so multiple interpretations are possible)
    Example: “A tool to gain user insights from social media” → the intention is understandable, but the term “insights” is ambiguous
4: A single specific product can be clearly imagined
    Example: A washing machine that can be controlled by voice

Evaluate CRITICALLY and provide a score based on the definitions above.
