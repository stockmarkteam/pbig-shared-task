# Annotation Guidance (Market Evaluation)

## Idea Evaluation Procedure

Please evaluate ideas in the following order. The scoring criteria for each aspect are defined below.

1. **Evaluate Specificity**
   * If the Specificity score is 0, 1 or 2, **end the evaluation** for that idea (do not evaluate Need validity or Market size).
   * If the score is 3 or 4, continue to the next step.
2. **Evaluate Need validity**
3. **Evaluate Market size**

## Score Definitions

### Specificity

Refer to [for_tech_group.md](guidelines/for_tech_group.md#specificity) for the definition of Specificity.

### Need validity

Need validity is an indicator of "how deep the need is that the idea addresses."
Please evaluate Need validity from two perspectives: (1) toC and (2) toB.
The overall score will be the sum of the two scores.

**(Need validity) toC**
If the idea is a toC product/service, evaluate its need. If it's a toB product, evaluate the toC need (※) that the toB product addresses.
(※) For example, for smartphone manufacturing equipment, evaluate the need for smartphones. For a flood protection wall, evaluate the need for flood protection.

* **0**: Consumer needs cannot be judged / Consumer product cannot be imagined.
* **1 (Small):** A need is felt, but the qualitative/quantitative cost is low, so most people do not seek a solution.
  * *Example: Earphone cables getting tangled.*
* **2 (Medium):** A need is felt, and there is a certain level of qualitative/quantitative cost. However, it's not critical, so some people may not seek a solution.
  * *Example: Feeling shoulder stiffness from PC work.*
* **3 (Large):** A need is felt, and the qualitative/quantitative cost is significant. A solution is definitely required.
  * *Example: Fall risk for elderly people living at home.*

**(Need validity) toB**
Please evaluate the toB perspective based on the following viewpoints. However, if it is a toC product, select "0 (not_to_b)".

* **0 (not_to_b) (Not toB):** Not a toB product.
* **0 (cannot_judge):** It is a toB product, but the need cannot be judged.
* **1 (Small):** Both qualitative and quantitative returns are low.
* **2 (Medium):** Either quantitative returns (returns easily measured as monetary outcomes) or qualitative returns (returns necessary for corporate growth) are large
  * *Example of quantitative returns: Cost reduction.*
  * *Example of qualitative returns: Technology transfer.*
* **3 (Large):** Both quantitative and qualitative returns are large.

### Market size

Market size is an indicator of "how many people/companies have that need."
Similar to Need validity, Market size will also be evaluated from two perspectives: (1) toC and (2) toB.

**(Market size) toC**
If the idea is a toC product/service, evaluate its market size.
If it's a toB product, similar to Need validity, evaluate the market size of the toC need that the toB product addresses.

* **0: toC size cannot be judged / Consumer product cannot be imagined.**

* **1 (Small):** People who want it will want it; not a daily necessity.
  * *Examples: VR goggles, road bikes.*
* **2 (Medium):** About 40-60% of people/households would want it; not necessarily a daily necessity.
  * *Examples: Tablets, coffee makers, backpacks.*
* **3 (Large):** 70-80% or more of people/households want it; a daily necessity.
  * *Examples: Toothbrushes, smartphones.*

**(Market size) toB**
Please evaluate the toB perspective based on the following viewpoints. If it is a toC product, select "0 (not_to_b)".# 

* **0 (not_to_b) (Not toB):** Not a toB product.
* **0 (cannot_judge):** It is a toB product, but the size cannot be judged.
* **1 (Small):** Niche, but appeals to some companies.
  * *Example: Accelerating PoC for automotive parts.*
* **2 (Medium):** Many companies have a certain level of awareness of the issue, and introduction decisions vary depending on budget and system.
  * *Example: BI tools.*
* **3 (Large):** Necessary for almost all (80% or more) companies.
  * *Example: Procurement management tools.*
