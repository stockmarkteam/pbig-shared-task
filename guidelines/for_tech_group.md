# Annotation Guidance (Technical Evaluation)

## Idea Evaluation Procedure

Please evaluate ideas in the following order. The scoring criteria for each aspect are defined below.

1. **Evaluate Specificity**
   * If the Specificity score is 0, 1 or 2, **end the evaluation** for that idea (do not evaluate Technical Validity, Innovativeness or Competitive advantages).
   * If the score is 3 or 4, continue to the next step.
2. **Evaluate Technical Validity**
   * If the score is 0 or 1, **end the evaluation** (do not evaluate Innovativeness).
   * If the score is 2 or higher, continue.
3. **Evaluate Innovativeness**

## Score Definitions

### Specificity (4-point scale)

Measures how concrete or specific the idea is. Score based on the following:

* **0**: Cannot judge / lack of domain knowledge makes evaluation impossible
* **1**: Not readable as language (incoherent or meaningless)
* **2**: Readable, but the intent or meaning of the idea is unclear; hard to imagine a specific product or service
  * *Example*: “A platform that contributes to carbon neutrality” → too vague
* **3**: Can imagine one or more possible products (some ambiguity remains)
  * *Example*: “A tool for gaining user insights from social media” → intent is clear, but “insights” is vague
* **4**: A single specific product is clearly imaginable
  * *Example*: A voice-controlled washing machine

### Technical Validity (4-point scale)

* **0**: Cannot judge
* **1**: The patent technology does not seem applicable or is unsuitable for the proposed use
* **2**: There are technical challenges, but a prototype could still be built using the technology
* **3**: A prototype could realistically be built using the patented technology
* **4**: The patented technology can be directly applied to a product-level implementation

### Innovativeness (5-point scale)

* **0**: Cannot judge
* **1**: Application is already well-known; lacks novelty
* **2**: Similar uses exist but the domain is still underexplored
* **3**: Uncommon use of the technology, but not particularly exciting
* **4**: Unexpected and interesting; not quite revolutionary
* **5**: Clearly an innovative and groundbreaking idea

### Competitive Advantages (4-point scale)

First, evaluate the idea based on two criteria (A and B):

* **Criterion A**: Is it difficult to imitate the business idea using the technology
  * *Example NOT satisfying A*: “Extracting time expressions from text” → Easily replaceable by common tech
  * *Example satisfying A*: “Making high-accuracy recommendations with a small amount of training data” → Hard to replicate
* **Criterion B**: Is the technology essential to the core of the business idea?
  * *Example NOT satisfying B*: “Improving fuel efficiency by lightening car audio speakers” → Speaker weight has minimal impact
  * *Example satisfying B*: “Improving fuel efficiency by lightening the main car body” → Major contribution to the goal

Then, assign a score as follows:

* **0**: Cannot judge
* **1**: Satisfies neither A nor B
* **2**: Satisfies B only (core idea, but weak technology)
* **3**: Satisfies A only (strong technology, but not core to the idea)
* **4**: Satisfies both A and B
